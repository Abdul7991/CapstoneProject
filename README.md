# CapstoneProject

This project was based on a postcode searcher:
Using a lambda function and API gateway we have been able to produce a function that calls differnt API's and presents the information on a front end application.

The key information that was provided includes:
- Parliamentary Constituency
- Nearby Postcodes (using the derived longitude and latitude)
- Crime Data (latest 10 results)
- Planning permissions (within a 2 mile radius)
